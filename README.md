Why This Project?

As a frontend engineer, I wanted to showcase my skills in frontend development and my ability to handle complex user interaction scenarios. By remaking a widely used and familiar application like the Windows 10 Calculator, I was able to demonstrate my technical proficiency and attention to detail.

I welcome feedback and contributions to this project, and I'm excited to continue expanding its functionality and improving its user experience.
